# Regularity Lemma for Graphons

This file states the regularity lemma for graphons, which says that any graphon
can be approximated by a step graphon in cut norm.

## Main results

* `Graphon.regularity` - For any ε > 0, there exists a partition with bounded
  number of parts such that the stepified graphon is ε-close in cut norm.

## Implementation notes

The regularity lemma is one of the central results in graphon theory. It is the
continuous analogue of Szemerédi's regularity lemma for graphs.

The number of parts in the partition depends only on ε, not on the graphon.
This is crucial for applications to graph limits.

/-- The "defect" of a partition: measures how far W is from being stepwise constant.

For a partition P and rectangle S × T, the defect is:
∫_{S×T} |W(x,y) - rectAverage W S T|² dμ(x) dμ(y)

The total defect is the sum over all partition rectangles.
When W is close to stepified P W in cut norm, the defect is small. -/

  P.parts.sum fun S =>
    P.parts.sum fun T =>
      ∫ p in S ×ˢ T, (W.toAEEqFun p - rectAverage W S T) ^ 2 ∂(μ.prod μ)

/-- Key identity: L² norm = energy + defect.

‖W‖₂² = E(P, W) + D(P, W)

where E(P, W) is the energy and D(P, W) is the defect.
This follows from the Pythagorean theorem for L² orthogonal projections. -/

  -- Proof uses: for each rectangle S × T,

/-- Energy increment lemma (Frieze-Kannan style).

If W has large defect on some rectangle S × T of P, then refining that
rectangle increases the energy.

More precisely: if there exist S, T ∈ P such that
∫_{S×T} |W - rectAverage W S T|² ≥ ε² μ(S) μ(T),
then splitting S (or T) into two parts by an appropriate cut increases
the energy by at least ε⁴/4 (or similar constant).

This is the key step that drives the regularity iteration. -/

  -- 1. If ∫_{S×T} (W - avg)² ≥ ε² μ(S) μ(T), then W varies significantly on S × T
  -- 2. By Markov/Chebyshev, there exists a measurable cut S = S₁ ∪ S₂ such that
  --    |rectAverage W S₁ T - rectAverage W S T| ≥ ε/2 or similar
  -- 3. Replacing S with S₁, S₂ in P gives Q
  -- 4. The energy increase comes from: new terms have (avg on smaller set)²
  --    which by convexity arguments increases the sum

/-! ### Regularity lemma -/

section Regularity

variable [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

/-- The regularity function: given ε, returns an upper bound on the number of parts
    needed in a partition to achieve ε-approximation.

For Frieze-Kannan regularity, the bound is polynomial in 1/ε (roughly 1/ε⁸).
This is much better than the tower bound in Szemerédi's lemma. -/
noncomputable def regularityBound (ε : ℝ) : ℕ :=
  if ε ≤ 0 then 0 else Nat.ceil (1 / ε ^ 8)

/-- The Frieze-Kannan weak regularity lemma.

For any ε > 0 and any graphon W, there exists a measurable partition P with
at most O(1/ε⁸) parts such that W has small defect on P.

This implies that W is ε-close to the step graphon stepify P W in cut norm.

**Proof outline** (Frieze-Kannan [1999]):
1. Start with trivial partition P₀ = {α}
2. While there exists a "bad" rectangle (defect ≥ ε² per unit area):
   - Apply energy_increment to get P_{i+1}
   - This increases energy by ≥ ε⁴/C
3. Since energy ≤ 1, we get at most C/ε⁴ iterations
4. Each iteration at most doubles parts, so final count ≤ 2^{C/ε⁴}
5. More careful analysis gives polynomial bound ~1/ε⁸ -/
theorem regularity (W : Graphon α μ) (ε : ℝ) (hε : ε > 0) :
    ∃ P : MeasurablePartition α μ,
      P.parts.card ≤ regularityBound ε ∧
      defect W P ≤ ε ^ 2 := by
  -- The proof iterates energy_increment until defect is small
