# Compactness of Graphon Space

This file develops the compactness properties of the space of graphons
with respect to cut distance.

## Main definitions

* `Graphon.Quotient` - The quotient of graphons by weak isomorphism (δ□ = 0)
* `Graphon.cutDistanceQuotient` - Cut distance as a proper metric on the quotient

## Main results

* `Graphon.cutDistance_quotient_metric` - Cut distance is a metric on the quotient
* `Graphon.quotient_compact` - The quotient space is compact

## Implementation notes

The space of graphons modulo weak isomorphism, equipped with cut distance,
is a compact metric space. This is the fundamental compactness result that
enables the theory of graph limits.

The compactness follows from:
1. The regularity lemma gives total boundedness
2. Completeness follows from a martingale convergence argument

/-- Two graphons are weakly isomorphic iff their cut distance is zero. -/
def WeaklyIsomorphic (U W : Graphon α μ) : Prop :=
  cutDistance U W = 0

/-- Weak isomorphism is reflexive. -/
theorem WeaklyIsomorphic.refl (W : Graphon α μ) : WeaklyIsomorphic W W :=
  cutDistance_self W

/-- Weak isomorphism is symmetric.

Note: With the two-sided cut distance definition, this no longer requires `StandardBorelSpace`. -/
theorem WeaklyIsomorphic.symm {U W : Graphon α μ}
    (h : WeaklyIsomorphic U W) : WeaklyIsomorphic W U := by
  unfold WeaklyIsomorphic at *
  rw [cutDistance_symm]
  exact h

/-- Weak isomorphism is transitive (on standard Borel spaces). -/
theorem WeaklyIsomorphic.trans [StandardBorelSpace α] {U V W : Graphon α μ}

  have h_tri := cutDistance_triangle U V W
  have h_nonneg := cutDistance_nonneg U W

/-- Weak isomorphism is an equivalence relation (on standard Borel spaces).

Note: Only `trans` still requires `StandardBorelSpace` (for the triangle inequality). -/

/-- Relationship between `WeaklyIsomorphic` and `WeakIso`:

`WeakIso U W` (one-sided pullback relation) implies `WeaklyIsomorphic U W` (cutDistance = 0).

The converse direction (cutDistance = 0 implies WeakIso in both directions) requires
additional structure on the probability space (e.g., standard Borel). -/

/-! ### Total boundedness -/

section TotalBoundedness

variable [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

/-- The space of graphons is totally bounded with respect to cut distance.

For any ε > 0, there exists a finite set of graphons such that every
graphon is within ε (in cut distance) of some element of the set.

This follows from the regularity lemma: step graphons with bounded
number of parts form an ε-net. -/
theorem totallyBounded (ε : ℝ) (hε : ε > 0) :
    ∃ (S : Finset (Graphon α μ)), ∀ W : Graphon α μ, ∃ V ∈ S, cutDistance W V ≤ ε := by
  -- The regularity lemma gives a partition P with ≤ regularityBound ε parts
  -- Step graphons on such partitions form a finite set
  -- Every graphon is close to its stepification
  sorry

section Completeness

variable [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

/-- A sequence of graphons is Cauchy with respect to cut distance. -/
def IsCauchy (W : ℕ → Graphon α μ) : Prop :=
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ m n, m ≥ N → n ≥ N → cutDistance (W m) (W n) < ε

/-- The space of graphons is complete with respect to cut distance.

Every Cauchy sequence of graphons converges (modulo weak isomorphism).

The proof uses a martingale convergence argument:
1. Take successive refinements of partitions
2. The stepified graphons form a martingale
3. Martingale convergence gives a limit -/
theorem complete (W : ℕ → Graphon α μ) (hW : IsCauchy W) :
    ∃ V : Graphon α μ, ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, cutDistance (W n) V < ε := by

section Compactness

variable [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

/-- The space of graphons (modulo weak isomorphism) is compact.

This is the fundamental compactness theorem for graphon theory.
It follows from total boundedness (regularity lemma) and completeness. -/
theorem compact :
    ∀ (W : ℕ → Graphon α μ), ∃ (V : Graphon α μ) (φ : ℕ → ℕ),
      StrictMono φ ∧ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, cutDistance (W (φ n)) V < ε := by
  -- Every sequence has a Cauchy subsequence (total boundedness)
  -- Cauchy sequences converge (completeness)
  sorry
