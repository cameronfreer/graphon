# Compactness of Graphon Space

This file develops the compactness properties of the space of graphons
with respect to cut distance.

## Main definitions

* `Graphon.Quotient` - The quotient of graphons by weak isomorphism (δ□ = 0)
* `Graphon.cutDistanceQuotient` - Cut distance as a proper metric on the quotient

## Main results

* `Graphon.cutDistance_quotient_metric` - Cut distance is a metric on the quotient
* `Graphon.quotient_compact` - The quotient space is compact

## Implementation notes

The space of graphons modulo weak isomorphism, equipped with cut distance,
is a compact metric space. This is the fundamental compactness result that
enables the theory of graph limits.

The compactness follows from:
1. The regularity lemma gives total boundedness
2. Completeness follows from a martingale convergence argument

`WeakIso U W` (one-sided pullback relation) implies `WeaklyIsomorphic U W` (cutDistance = 0).

The converse direction (cutDistance = 0 implies WeakIso in both directions) requires
additional structure on the probability space (e.g., standard Borel). -/

/-! ### Total boundedness -/

section TotalBoundedness

variable [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

/-- The space of graphons is totally bounded with respect to cut distance.

For any ε > 0, there exists a finite set of graphons such that every
graphon is within ε (in cut distance) of some element of the set.

This follows from the regularity lemma: step graphons with bounded
number of parts form an ε-net.

**Proof outline**:
1. Let k = regularityBound(ε/2) be the max number of partition parts
2. Step graphons on k parts are determined by k² coefficients in [0,1]
3. Discretize [0,1] into intervals of width δ (for suitable δ)
4. This gives finitely many "grid" step graphons
5. By regularity, any W has a step approximation S with defect ≤ (ε/2)²
6. The grid point nearest to S is within ε/2 of S in cut distance
7. Triangle: W is within ε of the grid point

**Depends on**: regularity lemma (has sorry), step graphon construction -/
theorem totallyBounded (ε : ℝ) (hε : ε > 0) :
    ∃ (S : Finset (Graphon α μ)), ∀ W : Graphon α μ, ∃ V ∈ S, cutDistance W V ≤ ε := by
  sorry

end TotalBoundedness

/-! ### Completeness -/

section Completeness

variable [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

/-- A sequence of graphons is Cauchy with respect to cut distance. -/
def IsCauchy (W : ℕ → Graphon α μ) : Prop :=
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ m n, m ≥ N → n ≥ N → cutDistance (W m) (W n) < ε

/-- The space of graphons is complete with respect to cut distance.

Every Cauchy sequence of graphons converges (modulo weak isomorphism).

**Proof approach** (diagonal extraction, avoiding martingales):
1. For each n, use regularity to get a step approximation of W n
2. The step graphon coefficients (rectangle averages) live in [0,1]
3. By compactness of [0,1]^k, extract subsequence where all coefficients converge
4. Define limit V as the graphon with limiting coefficients
5. Show W(φ(n)) → V in cut distance

**Dependencies**:
- regularity: gives step approximation with bounded partition
- totallyBounded: provides finite ε-net structure
- Both currently have sorries, blocking this proof -/
theorem complete (W : ℕ → Graphon α μ) (hW : IsCauchy W) :
    ∃ V : Graphon α μ, ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, cutDistance (W n) V < ε := by
  -- The proof requires regularity (step approximation) and totallyBounded
  -- which are upstream sorries. Once those are filled, the diagonal
  -- extraction argument follows:
  --
  -- 1. For each k, use regularity with ε = 1/k to get partition P_k
  -- 2. Rectangle averages of W_n form sequences in [0,1]^{|P_k|²}
  -- 3. Diagonal extraction: find subsequence where all converge
  -- 4. Limit graphon has these limiting averages on limiting partition
  --
  -- Key lemmas needed:
  -- - cutNormDiff_le_stepify: W is close to stepify P W in cutNorm
  -- - stepify convergence: if coefficients converge, stepified graphons converge
  sorry

section Compactness

variable [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

/-- The space of graphons (modulo weak isomorphism) is compact.

This is the fundamental compactness theorem for graphon theory.
It follows from total boundedness (regularity lemma) and completeness.

**Structure**: This is sequential compactness, equivalent to compactness
for metric spaces (which graphon space is, modulo weak isomorphism). -/
theorem compact :
    ∀ (W : ℕ → Graphon α μ), ∃ (V : Graphon α μ) (φ : ℕ → ℕ),
      StrictMono φ ∧ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, cutDistance (W (φ n)) V < ε := by
  intro W
  -- Step 1: Extract Cauchy subsequence from totallyBounded
  -- totallyBounded gives: for all ε, finite ε-net exists
  -- Standard argument: for ε = 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... extract nested subsequences
  -- Diagonal: the n-th element of the n-th subsequence gives Cauchy
  --
  -- Step 2: Apply complete to get limit V
  --
  -- Currently blocked by sorries in totallyBounded and complete
